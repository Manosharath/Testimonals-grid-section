              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were
              current, if not more so,in the company i joined. I honestly feel i
              got every penny's worth.

              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
              life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched
              careers, working as a Software Engineering at a VR startup. "

                "Before joininf the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. i needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience . It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offer. 100% recommend! "
